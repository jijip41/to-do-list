# FAC22 Pre-course week9 project

## To-do list tracker

### User stories

#### Core

- []Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them
- [] Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done
- [] Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore
- [] Use all the features of the app without a mouse

#### Stretch

- [] Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do

### Acceptance Criteria

- A working to-do list
- Tests for (at least) each user story
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
